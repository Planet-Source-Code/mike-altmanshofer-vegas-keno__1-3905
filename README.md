## vegas keno


</div>

### Description

This code is the complete source code to a Keno game I modeled after a video keno machine in Las Vegas. I submitted this game to zdnets website about 6 months ago as freeware. The code is a bit sloppy it was one of my first attempts at something that worked. I thought some of the algorythms and procedures might be helpful. The program has sound, print, save, registry calls, load, and an autoplay feature. I'm sure it can be improved on.

The code uses alot of simple features and techniques, that are easy to understand thought this would be very helpful to beginners even though there not all exactly the correct way to do things.

This code is not the rule. Several procedures are not exactly text book examples. But have fun anyway.

none known, has been tested on several machines. Seems to run slowly on anything below 66mhz.
